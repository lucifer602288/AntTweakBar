# AntTweakBar library

AntTweakBar is a small and easy-to-use C/C++ library that allows programmers
to quickly add a light and intuitive GUI into OpenGL and DirectX(9, 10, 11) based
graphic programs to interactively tweak parameters.

This package includes the source version of the AntTweakBar library and some
program examples.

**The original author, Philippe Decaudin, does no longer maintain the code, so
this fork is an attempt to combine the updates that can be found in other
(divergent) forks.**
